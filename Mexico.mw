The northern border is the United States; the Pacific Ocean to the south and west; Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea to the east, and the Gulf of Mexico to the east.  Mexico covers 1,972,550 square kilometers (761,610 sq mi) and has a population of about 128,649,565, making it the 13th largest country in the world, the 10th most populous country and  is a Spanish-speaking nation with a large population of 31 countries and [Mexico City], its capital and largest city. Other major urban areas include Guadalajara  , Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana, Ciudad Juárez and León.

Pre-Columbian Mexico dates back to 8,000 BC and is known as one of six generations of development;  it was the home of many of the advanced Mesoamerica nations, the most famous among them being the Maya and the Aztecs.  In 1521, the Government of [Spain] conquered and occupied the area from Mexico City, then known as New Spain.  The Catholic Church played a key role in the conversion of millions of natives.  These settlers were exploited for mining, which turned out to be a huge asset to the Spaniards.  Mexico became an independent country after the successful Mexican independence war against [Spain] in 1821.

The Texas Independence War in 1836 and the Mexican-American War caused a great loss of territory in the northern part of the Mexican population, which merged with the United States.  Recent reforms that provided protection to indigenous peoples, as well as reduced military and ecclesiastical powers, were incorporated into the Constitution of 1857. This led to the Cold War and French intervention.  Maximilian Habsburg was installed as emperor by France and Benito Juárez kept the oppressive republic in captivity.  The following decades were marked by instability and oppression by Porfirio Díaz, who tried to improve Mexico and restore order.  The protocol ended with the Mexican Revolution in 1910 and the party that won the Constitution launched a new Constitution of 1917. The revolutionary leaders of the northern conquering party ruled in the 1920s and served as presidents, but  The 1928 assassination of Alvaro Obregón led to the formation of the Institutional Revolutionary Party in 1929, in which Mexico was a one-party state until 2000.

Mexico is a developing country, ranked 76th in the Human Development Index, but is considered a country recently developed by several analysts.  It has the 15th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP and the 11th largest by the PPP, with the United States as its largest economic partner.  Great economies, territories, populations and politics make Mexico a regional and central power, and it is often known as emerging power.  However, Mexico continues to fight against social inequality, poverty, and widespread crime;  the country ranks below the Global Peace Index.  Since 2006, conflicts between the government and drug trafficking organizations have led to more than 120,000 people.

Mexico ranks first in the United States and 7th in the world for the number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.  Mexico is a country of environmental and ecological megadiverse, ranked fifth in the world in its natural flora. Mexico receives a large number of tourists every year;  in 2018, it was the 6th most visited country in the world, with 39 million international visitors.  Mexico is a member of the United Nations (UN), the World Trade Organization (WTO), the G8 + 5, the G20, the UN Uniting for Consensus group, and the Pacific Alliance trade bloc.
