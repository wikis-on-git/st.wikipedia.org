The True Jesus Church is an independent church that was established in Beijing, China in 1917. Today, there are approximately 1.5 million members in forty five countries. The church belongs to the Pentecostal branch of Christianity that emerged during the early 20th Century. The church disagrees with the Trinity concept and follows the "Jesus-name doctrine" instead. Since 1997, this church was established in South Africa. Christmas and Easter are not celebrated by the church since it has pagan origins.

The ten basic doctrines of the church are:
#'''Holy Spirit''' - The church believes that "speaking in tongues" is evidence of receiving the Holy Spirit. 
#'''Baptism''' - This is conducted in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ with the person's head facing downwards and fully immersed into natural living water.
#'''Holy Communion'''
#'''Sabbath day''' - Unlike most other denominations, the church keeps the Sabbath on Saturday instead of Sunday.
#'''Feet washing'''
#'''Jesus Christ'''
#'''Holy Bible''' - consists of the Old and New Testaments, is inspired by God and is the standard for Christian living.
#'''Salvation''' - is given by the grace of God through faith. 
#'''Church'''
#'''Last Judgment'''
